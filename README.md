ASP&#46;NET MVC for Absolute Beginners: Your Secret Decoder Ring
=====================================
ASP&#46;NET MVC is filled with hidden conventions: put a controller or view in a certain place and give it a special name, and it magically works. If you know the conventions, you can quickly get an application up and running. But if you don't know the secret codes, all is lost. In this session, you will learn the conventions of ASP&#46;NET MVC around controllers, views, parameters, layouts, and routing. Once you have the decoder ring, you can focus on the parts of your web application that make it unique.

Code
----------
The code contains a "Starter" and "Completed" folder.  

The "**Completed**" project is an ASP&#46;NET application that generates mazes based on selected parameters.  

The "**Starter**" folder has the maze library code and a "Snippets.txt" file with code that is added to the various files in the MVC project.  

For initial creation of the MVC project and a walkthrough of conventions, see the article mentioned below "The Secret Code: ASP&#46;NET Conventions".  

For information on the Maze project, see "Generating Mazes in a Browser" & "Building a Web Front-End to Show Mazes in ASP&#46;NET Core MVC".
